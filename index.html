             <p>The University is Deputized by CHED to implement the Expanded <br> Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program <br> (ETEEAP) with the BS INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY as one of <br> the ETEEAP Degree Programs offered by the College. <br> The ETEEAP is a comprehensive educational assessment <br> program at the tertiary level that recognizes, accredits, and gives <br> equivalencies to knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values gained <br> by individuals from relevant work. This program recognizes that <br> education and the acquisition of higher expertise also take <br> place beyond the confines of the classroom. The <br> BSIT degree may be granted to individuals through the <br> recognition of their knowledge and skills gained from <br> non-formal or informal learning. The recognition of the <br> knowledge and skills are done through equivalency  <br>and assessment by assessors of the College.</p>
